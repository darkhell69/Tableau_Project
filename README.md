# Tableau_Project


The Coronavirus Dashboard Report project was developed to provide an interactive, visual representation of the global impact of COVID-19 using **Tableau**. The dashboard compiles real-time data on confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries from reliable sources like **Johns Hopkins University**, **WHO**, or **Kaggle datasets**. It enables users to explore trends, patterns, and geographic distribution of the virus through intuitive visuals and filters.

The project involved data cleaning and transformation using **Excel** and **Power Query**, followed by the integration of multiple datasets into Tableau. Key features of the dashboard include:

- **Global and country-wise breakdown** of COVID-19 cases  
- **Time-series visualizations** showing trends in daily and cumulative cases  
- **Interactive maps** displaying hotspots and recovery rates by region  
- **Dynamic filters** to explore data by date, location, or status (active, recovered, deceased)  
- **KPI cards** for quick access to total cases, deaths, and recovery percentages
